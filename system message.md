# LangChain Prompting Issue with Gemini Models and Batch Processing

## Problem Description:

When using LangChain's `.batch()` method with `ChatGoogleGenerativeAI` (Gemini models) and a prompt template loaded directly from a file (e.g., using `ChatPromptTemplate.from_template`), the LLM sometimes fails to correctly substitute variables within the template. Instead of outputting the processed result (e.g., a corrected sentence), it might literally output the variable placeholder string (e.g., `'{corrected_utterance}'`).

This issue was observed in the `correction_chain` where the input was a list of dictionaries mapping directly to the template variables (`{'prior_context': ..., 'utterance_to_correct': ...}`). Attempts to fix this by explicitly mapping inputs using `itemgetter` were unsuccessful.

## Root Cause Hypothesis:

The issue likely stems from how the LangChain adapter for Gemini handles prompt structures during batch processing when using a single combined template. The model may struggle to reliably differentiate between the instructional parts of the prompt and the specific input data placeholders for each item in the batch, leading it to misinterpret the placeholder as literal text.

## Solution:

Refactor the prompt definition to use explicit `SystemMessage` and `HumanMessage` components via `ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages`:

1.  **`SystemMessage`**: Contains the general instructions, role, and desired output format for the LLM (e.g., "You are a grammar corrector... Output ONLY the corrected text..."). This remains constant for the task.
2.  **`HumanMessage`**: Contains the specific input data for each instance, including the placeholders for variables (e.g., `Prior Context: {prior_context}\nClause to Correct: {utterance_to_correct}\nCorrected Clause:`).

```python
from langchain_core.prompts import ChatPromptTemplate, SystemMessagePromptTemplate, HumanMessagePromptTemplate
from operator import itemgetter

system_instruction = "Your detailed instructions here..."
human_template = "Context: {prior_context}\nInput: {input_variable}\nOutput:"

correction_prompt = ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages([
    SystemMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(system_instruction),
    HumanMessagePromptTemplate.from_template(human_template)
])

chain = (
    {
        "prior_context": itemgetter("prior_context"), 
        "input_variable": itemgetter("input_variable")
    }
    | correction_prompt
    | llm 
    | StrOutputParser()
)
```

## Why it Works:

This structure explicitly separates the constant instructions (System) from the variable instance data (Human). This aligns better with the expected input format for chat models like Gemini, especially during batch processing. It removes ambiguity and helps the model correctly process the input variables for each item in the batch according to the system instructions.

## Recommendation:

When encountering issues with prompt variable substitution in LangChain, especially with chat models and batch processing, prefer using the `SystemMessage`/`HumanMessage` structure with `ChatPromptTemplate.from_messages` over a single template string.
