# Clause Analysis Task (Foster et al., 2000)

## Primary Task
Analyze each AS-unit to identify and classify clauses.

## CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS
- EVERY utterance MUST have at least one clause, even if fragmentary or lacking a finite verb
- Treat elliptical constructions (with implied subjects/verbs) as valid clauses
- For fragments, identify the implied elements and mark them in implied_elements

## Process
1. Identify all clauses within each AS-unit
2. Classify each clause as main, coordinate, subordinate, or non-finite
3. For subordinate clauses, specify the subtype (adverbial, relative, complement)
4. Note any implied elements that are not explicitly stated

## Guidelines for Analysis

### Clause Types

1. **Main Clause**
   - Contains a subject and finite verb, can stand alone
   - Fragments and elliptical constructions count as main clauses with implied elements
   - Example: "I serves in a organization" → main clause
   - Example: "maybe twenty years" → main clause with implied elements ["it is", "it has been"]

2. **Coordinate Clause**
   - Joined to a main clause with coordinating conjunction (and, but, or)
   - Each has own subject-verb relationship (explicit or implied)
   - Could function independently if separated
   - Example: "I like pizza and she prefers pasta" → main + coordinate

3. **Subordinate Clause**
   - Depends on a main clause, introduced by a subordinating conjunction
   - Types:
     - **Adverbial**: "when I was in university, I specialized"
     - **Relative/Phrasal Post-modifier**: "I serve in an organization which is called department"
     - **Complement**: "I think that he knows nothing"
     - **Subject**: "That he knows nothing creates problems"

4. **Non-finite Clause**
   - Contains a non-finite verb form (infinitive, gerund, participle)
   - Must have at least one additional clause element beyond the verb
   - Example: "I want to study crop protection" → "to study crop protection" is non-finite

### Special Cases

1. **Fragments and Ellipsis**
   - Treat as main clauses with implied elements
   - Example: "very good" → main clause with implied ["it is", "that is"]
   - Example: "near here" → main clause with implied ["it is", "I am"]

2. **Coordinated Verb Phrases**
   - Count as single clause unless first phrase marked by intonation/pause
   - Example: "I went to store and bought milk" → single main clause

### Verification
- Check for minimum finite verb in independent clauses (or identify implied verbs)
- Verify subordinate clauses have verb plus one other element
- Ensure EVERY utterance has at least one clause, even if fragmentary
