# Consistent Testing & Debugging Lessons (Analyzer Service)

Based on debugging the preprocessing chain, here are key takeaways to apply when developing and testing subsequent chains:

1.  **Prompt/Parser Alignment is Critical:** Ensure LLM prompt instructions and examples generate output *exactly* matching the format expected by the downstream parser (e.g., `NewlineListOutputParser`, `PydanticOutputParser`). Check expected data types, list formats (newline vs. JSON), and field names.

2.  **Isolate Errors with Focused Debugging:** When a chain fails, use logging (`logger.debug`) or print statements immediately before and after the specific `Runnable` or function call you suspect. Inspect the *exact* input it receives and the *exact* output it produces.

3.  **Investigate `Optional`/`null` Values:** Making schema fields `Optional` can fix `ValidationError`s but might hide deeper issues. If data is unexpectedly `null` or missing, investigate *why* it's not being generated or passed correctly upstream before relying solely on `Optional`.

4.  **Validate Data Flow & Merging:** When combining data (e.g., unpacking Pydantic models with `.model_dump()`, using `RunnablePassthrough.assign`), double-check argument passing. Ensure you aren't accidentally overwriting data or providing duplicate keyword arguments. Use `exclude` or `include` in `.model_dump()` or explicit variable assignment where needed.

5.  **Use File Output for Complex Data Review:** For chains producing complex, nested data, write results to a file (`.json`, `.txt`) with pretty-printing (`indent=4`). This is much easier for manual inspection than terminal output.

6.  **Consider Component Unit Tests:** While end-to-end tests (`run_..._test.py`) are vital, consider unit tests for individual helper functions, parsers, or custom `RunnableLambda` functions. Mocking inputs/outputs can speed up debugging isolated logic.
