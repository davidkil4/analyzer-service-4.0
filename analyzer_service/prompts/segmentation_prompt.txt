#AS-Unit Segmentation Protocol for Written Transcripts (Based on Foster et al., 2000)

##Operational Definition
Segment each speaker's utterance into AS-units containing either:
- An independent clause + associated subordinate clauses OR
- A sub-clausal unit/minor utterance with clear communicative value

##Critical Segmentation Cues for Written Transcripts
Prioritize these boundary markers in order:

Syntactic Features:

Independent clause boundaries
Subject changes between clauses
Coordinating conjunctions starting new clauses with new subjects
Sentence-final punctuation in the transcript (., ?, !)

## Semantic Completion:
- Completed thought/response unit
- Answer to explicit/implicit question
- New information contribution
- Topic shifts

##Segmentation Rules
###Core Components
Valid AS-Units MUST be:
✅ Independent clauses with finite verbs (explicit or recovered through ellipsis)
✅ Sub-clausal units serving complete communicative functions
✅ Minor utterances with discourse value (not mere echoes)
Always Include:

Self-corrections maintaining syntactic continuity
Repairs within same semantic unit
Discourse markers with propositional content ("Well,...", "Actually...")

###Exclusion Criteria
❌ Pure filler vocalizations ("um", "uh") without discourse function
❌ Abandoned utterances without recoverable meaning
❌ Exact immediate repetitions

###Special Case Handling
####Multi-Unit Division
Split into separate AS-Units when:
- New independent clause begins with a new subject
- Speaker changes semantic focus or topic
- Clear syntactic closure

####Single-Unit Retention
Keep as one AS-Unit when:
- Coordinated predicates share the same subject (e.g., "I went to the store and bought milk")
- Self-repairs maintain the same basic structure
- Subordinate clauses attach to main clause

###Input Specifications
####Transcription Characteristics:
- May lack accurate punctuation
- May include repetitions and false starts
- May contain grammatical errors typical of spoken language
- Will not contain reliable pause or intonation markers

###Output Format
CRITICAL:

One AS-unit per line
Preserve original wording exactly
NO numbering, explanations, or markup

###Examples
Input 1:
"Actually I think no wait the meeting starts at three unless it's canceled"
Output:
Actually I think no wait the meeting starts at three
unless it's canceled
Input 2:
"I went to the store yesterday and I bought some milk but they didn't have any eggs so I had to go to another store"
Output:
I went to the store yesterday and I bought some milk
but they didn't have any eggs
so I had to go to another store
Input 3:
"when I was young I loved playing outside especially in summer"
Output:
when I was young I loved playing outside especially in summer

###Final Validation Check
Before outputting, verify each AS-unit:
- Contains at least one clause (independent or sub-clausal)
- Represents a complete communicative act
- Aligns with strongest boundary evidence (syntactic > semantic)
- Handles coordinated structures correctly (same subject = same AS-unit)

### Input Utterance
{input_utterances}

## Required Output Format
CRITICAL: You MUST output ONLY the segmented AS-unit strings, one unit per line.
Do NOT include ANY other text, explanations, greetings, apologies, or formatting (like numbering or bullet points).
Each line in your output will be treated as a distinct AS-unit.

## Example
Input Utterance:
Yes. I like sports very much. But I cannot play well.

Expected Output:
Yes.
I like sports very much.
But I cannot play well.
