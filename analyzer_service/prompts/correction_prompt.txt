# Task: Correct the learner utterance based on context and grammatical rules.

# PRIOR CONVERSATION CONTEXT:
{{ prior_context }}

# LEARNER UTTERANCE TO CORRECT:
{{ utterance_to_correct }}

# INSTRUCTIONS:

## STEP 1: UNDERSTAND LEARNER INTENT
- Analyze the utterance in the context of the prior conversation
- Identify the communication goal (answering a question, making a request, etc.)
- Consider Korean-English specific patterns that might be present:
  * Subject omission (common in Korean)
  * Direct translation of Korean sentence structures
  * Topic-prominent structures instead of subject-prominent
  * Verb positioning at the end of clauses
  * Article/preposition challenges specific to Korean speakers

## STEP 2: MAKE GRAMMATICAL CORRECTIONS
- Correct all clear grammatical errors in:
  * Verb tense/aspect
  * Articles
  * Prepositions
  * Noun number
  * Pronoun reference
  * Quantifiers
  * Parallel structure
  * Subject-verb agreement
  * Word order in questions and statements
  * Spelling and punctuation

## STEP 3: APPLY NATURAL LANGUAGE PATTERNS
- Transform awkward but grammatically correct phrases into natural English
- Apply appropriate formulaic sequences (collocations, institutionalized phrases)
- Consider what a native speaker would naturally say in the same context
- Maintain the learner's intended meaning and vocabulary level

# OUTPUT FORMAT:
Return ONLY the corrected version of the learner utterance. Do not include explanations, labels, or the original text. If the utterance is already grammatically correct and natural-sounding, output it unchanged.
