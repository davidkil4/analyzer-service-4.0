Correct these EFL learner utterances with only NECESSARY changes to create natural, fluent English.

STEP 1: UNDERSTAND EFL LEARNER INTENT

For EACH input, analyze the utterance by:
1. COMPARING PRUNED AND ORIGINAL FORMS
   • Read the pruned version first for clear meaning
   • Reference original version to understand:
     - Self-correction attempts
     - Word search patterns
     - Communication strategies

2. ANALYZING LEARNER INTENT through:
   • Previous 3 utterances in context
   • Question-answer relationships
   • Topic development
   • Communication goals

3. IDENTIFYING KOREAN-ENGLISH SPECIFIC PATTERNS:
   • Subject omission (common in Korean)
   • Direct translation of Korean sentence structures
   • Literal word-for-word translations that sound unnatural
   • Topic-prominent structures instead of subject-prominent
   • Verb positioning at the end of clauses
   • Article/preposition challenges specific to Korean speakers

{% for item in batch %}

ITEM {{ item.n }} CONTEXT:
{% for ctx in item.context %}- {{ ctx }}
{% endfor %}
INPUT: {{ item.text }}
{% endfor %}

STEP 2: MAKE GRAMMATICAL CORRECTIONS
After understanding the intent, perform the following steps:

1. Grammatical Corrections
- Correct **all clear grammatical errors** in:
  • Verb tense/aspect • Articles • Prepositions
  • Noun number • Pronoun reference
  • Quantifiers ("minimum three" → "a minimum of three")
  • Parallel structure ("knowledge and skill of..." → "knowledge of... and skills in")
  • Subject-verb agreement
  • Word order in questions and statements

2. Natural Expression Transformations
- Transform awkward but grammatically correct phrases:
  • "My problem is only one" → "I have only one problem"
  • "This is tennis elbow by bad golf" → "This tennis elbow is from playing golf badly"
  • "So, now, I use the many times" → "So now, I use it frequently"
- When the original structure is fundamentally unnatural but grammatical, reconstruct the sentence
- Pay special attention to sentence structures that follow Korean patterns rather than English ones

STEP 3: APPLY FORMULAIC LANGUAGE PATTERNS
If the utterance remains unclear or non-native-like after grammatical corrections:

1. Identify Appropriate Formulaic Sequences
- Apply common formulaic sequences including:
  • Polywords (e.g., "by the way", "of course", "as well as")
  • Collocations (e.g., "make a decision", "strong opinion", "take responsibility")
  • Institutionalized phrases (e.g., "if you don't mind", "in other words", "to be honest")
  • Lexical bundles (e.g., "as a result of", "on the other hand", "in terms of")
  • Greetings and discourse markers: "Well", "You know", "I mean"
  • Fixed expressions: "as a matter of fact", "to tell you the truth"

2. Apply Pattern-Based Corrections
- Replace non-native expressions with equivalent formulaic sequences
- Maintain the learner's intended meaning and vocabulary level
- Only add sequences that are contextually appropriate
- Consider what a native speaker would naturally say in the same context

IMPORTANT NOTE ON APPROPRIATE CORRECTION:
- The goal is to create natural, fluent English that preserves the learner's intended meaning
- Use conversation context to resolve ambiguities and determine implied meanings
- When the literal translation is awkward but grammatically correct, prioritize creating a response that fits naturally in the conversation flow

# COMPREHENSIVE EXAMPLES

## Example 1: Intent Analysis & Basic Grammar
Original: "Ummm. Urr. First, urr relax I can feel relax and good for my health err and spent my boring time."
Pruned: "First, relax I can feel relax and good for my health and spent my boring time."
Context: [
    "I see. What is so good about playing golf?",
    "Pardon?",
    "What is good about playing golf?"
]
Analysis:
- Question requires listing benefits of golf
- Pruned version shows three main points: relaxation, health, free time
- Korean pattern: subject omission, direct translation
Correction: "First, I can relax, which is good for my health, and it helps me spend my free time."

## Example 2: Awkward But Grammatical Transformation
Original: "Ur. Fine, thank you. Urr. It it my problem is only one. Er."
Pruned: "Fine, thank you. It my problem is only one."
Context: [
    "Nice to meet you, too. May I ask your name?",
    "Yeah. Urr. My name is XXX02.",
    "O K. How are you today, Mister XXX02?"
]
Analysis:
- Responding to "how are you" with health status
- Grammatically problematic but intent is clear
- Korean pattern: topic-prominent structure "my problem is only one"
Correction: "Fine, thank you. I have only one problem."

## Example 3: Context-Informed Correction
Original: "Ummm. Long time. Maybe, twenty years or more."
Pruned: "Long time. Maybe, twenty years or more."
Context: [
    "I see.",
    "I like very I I like very much.",
    "How long have you been playing golf?"
]
Analysis:
- Answering "how long" question with time period
- Missing subject and verb based on context
- Requires adding implied subject from context
Correction: "I've been playing for a long time, maybe twenty years or more."

## Example 4: Combined Correction (Grammar + Formulaic)
Original: "Um... if possible I hoping change my schedule because I having important thing"
Pruned: "if possible I hoping change my schedule because I having important thing"
Context: [
    "So, next Tuesday at 2 PM?",
    "Yes, the team meeting.",
    "Is that time okay?"
]
Analysis:
- Professional request context
- Needs both grammar correction and formal request pattern
- Shows both verb form issues and lack of formal expression
Correction: "If possible, I would like to reschedule as I have an important commitment"
