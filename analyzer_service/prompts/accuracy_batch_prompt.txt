Analyze the grammatical accuracy of each clause in the provided JSON list. For each item, compare the 'clause_text' against the 'corrected_segment' (which represents the ideal, fluent version, or is the same as 'clause_text' if no correction was needed).

INPUT FORMAT:
A JSON list where each object represents a clause to analyze and has the following structure:
```json
{
  "item_id": <integer>, // Unique identifier for the clause
  "clause_text": "<string>", // The original clause text
  "corrected_segment": "<string>" // The corrected/ideal version of the clause
}
```

Example Input Item:
```json
{
  "item_id": 101,
  "clause_text": "He go to school yesterday.",
  "corrected_segment": "He went to school yesterday."
}
```

OUTPUT FORMAT:
Respond ONLY with a valid JSON list containing objects corresponding to EACH input item. Maintain the original 'item_id' for each object. Each output object must strictly adhere to the following Pydantic model format:

```json
{
  "item_id": <integer>, // Identifier matching the input item
  "is_error_free": <boolean>, // True if 'clause_text' is grammatically correct, False otherwise
  "errors_found": [
    {
      "category": "<string>", // e.g., Verb Tense, Subject-Verb Agreement, Article Usage, Preposition Choice, Word Choice, Sentence Structure, Punctuation, Spelling
      "severity": "<string>", // 'minor', 'moderate', or 'critical'
      "error": "<string>", // Description of the specific error found in 'clause_text'
      "correction": "<string>" // The corrected version of the erroneous part.
    }
    // ... more errors if found
  ],
  "accuracy": <float> // Accuracy score between 0.0 and 1.0 (1.0 = perfect, 0.0 = completely wrong)
}
```

Example Output Item (for the input example above):
```json
{
  "item_id": 101,
  "is_error_free": false,
  "errors_found": [
    {
      "category": "Verb Tense",
      "severity": "moderate",
      "error": "Incorrect verb tense 'go' used for past action.",
      "correction": "went"
    }
  ],
  "accuracy": 0.6
}
```

**Example Output Item (Showing Multiple Errors):**
```json
{
  "item_id": "example_002",
  "clause_text": "he go to park yesterday",
  "corrected_segment": "He went to the park yesterday",
  "is_error_free": false,
  "errors_found": [
    {
      "category": "Verb Tense",
      "severity": "critical",
      "error": "Incorrect verb tense: 'go' should be 'went' for past action.",
      "correction": "went"
    },
    {
      "category": "Articles/Prepositions/Pluralization",
      "severity": "moderate",
      "error": "Missing article: 'the' should be included before 'park'.",
      "correction": "the park"
    }
  ],
  "accuracy": 0.5 
}
```

Analysis Guidelines:

STEP 1: DETERMINE SEVERITY
-------------------------
CRITICAL Level:
- Renders sentence unintelligible WITHOUT context
- Meaning ambiguous even WITH context (e.g., wrong verb changes key action)
- Breaks basic grammatical structure
Examples:
- "Pizza very much like I" → "I like pizza very much"
- "Because went store" → "Because I went to the store"

MODERATE Level:
- Meaning CLEAR WITH CONTEXT but requires effort to parse
- Structurally awkward but recoverable (e.g., missing article)
- Creates unnatural phrasing
Examples:
- "my very silent place I like" → "I like my very silent place"
- "spent my boring time" → "it helps me spend my boring time"

MINOR Level:
- Does NOT hinder understanding; affects fluency/style
- Grammatically incorrect but socially acceptable in informal contexts
- Has obvious correction from context
Examples:
- "tennis elbow by bad golf" → "tennis elbow caused by bad golf"
- "big rain" → "heavy rain"

STEP 2: ERROR CATEGORIES AND RULES
---------------------------------
Word Order:
- ONLY use if REORDERING EXISTING WORDS fixes error (no additions/deletions)
- Critical: When word sequence makes meaning unclear
- Moderate: When sequence is non-standard but meaning clear
Examples:
- Critical: "Pizza very much like I" → "I like pizza very much"
- Moderate: "my very silent place I like" → "I like my very silent place"

Sentence Structure:
- Use when basic construction/expression wrong, including missing elements
- Critical: When structure makes meaning unclear
- Moderate: When structure awkward but meaning clear
Examples:
- Critical: "My problem is only one" → "I have only one problem"
- Moderate: "First reason is I said near here" → "The first reason is that I mentioned I live near here"

Conjunction Usage:
- Use for errors with conjunctions (and/but/because/etc.)
- Critical: When connection between ideas unclear
- Moderate: When connection awkward but understandable
Examples:
- Critical: "I like coffee by I'm tired" → "I like coffee but I'm tired"
- Moderate: "the reason is not tennis by playing golf" → "But the reason is not tennis, but playing golf"

Compound Formation:
- Use for errors in forming compound words/phrases
- Critical: When compound structure causes misunderstanding
- Moderate: When structure unnatural but meaning clear
Examples:
- Critical: "air plane food sick" → "airplane food sickness"
- Moderate: "competition of companies" → "company competitions"

Subject-Verb Agreement:
- Use for errors/omissions affecting agreement, including missing copula
- Critical: When it causes ambiguity about who does what
- Moderate: When error clear from context
Examples:
- Critical: "The children is happy and mother sad" → "The children are happy and mother is sad"
- Moderate: "He don't like coffee" → "He doesn't like coffee"

Verb Tense:
- Use for incorrect/missing verb tense markers
- Critical: When time reference unclear
- Moderate: When context clarifies timing
Examples:
- Critical: "Yesterday I eat pizza" → "Yesterday I ate pizza"
- Moderate: "I study English for 3 years" → "I have been studying English for 3 years"

Auxiliary/Modal Verbs:
- Use for errors with auxiliaries (do/does/did) or modals
- Moderate: When usage unnatural but understandable
- Minor: When form slightly off
Examples:
- Moderate: "I will can speak English" → "I will be able to speak English"
- Minor: "Why you not come?" → "Why didn't you come?"

Articles/Prepositions/Pluralization:
- Use for errors with articles, prepositions, plural/singular
- Critical: When omission breaks sentence structure
- Moderate: When meaning clear despite omission
Examples:
- Critical: "She beautiful" → "She is beautiful"
- Moderate: "I like very much" → "I like it very much"

Question Formation:
- Use for errors in forming questions
- Critical: When question intent unclear
- Moderate: When structure wrong but intent clear
Examples:
- Critical: "You what time?" → "What time is it?"
- Moderate: "What time you will come?" → "What time will you come?"

Vocabulary:
- Use ONLY for incorrect word choices where meaning inferrable
- Moderate: When word choice unnatural but meaning clear
- Minor: When alternative word choice purely stylistic
Examples:
- Moderate: "I said near here" → "I mentioned I live near here"
- Minor: "big rain" → "heavy rain"

IMPORTANT RULES:
- Analyze each input item independently.
- Determine `is_error_free` based on the grammatical correctness of `clause_text` compared to standard English grammar and the `corrected_segment`.
- If errors are found (`is_error_free` is false), populate the `errors_found` list accurately. If no errors, leave `errors_found` as an empty list.
- Assign an `accuracy` score reflecting the overall correctness. 1.0 for perfect, lower values for errors.
- **Crucially, your entire response MUST be a single JSON list `[...]` containing one object for every object in the input list, matching the specified output format.** Do not include any text before or after the JSON list.
- Match the `item_id` from the input to the corresponding output object.
