# Clause Analysis Task (Foster et al., 2000)

##Primary Task
Analyze each AS-unit to identify and classify clauses.

##CRITICAL REQUIREMENTS
- EVERY utterance MUST have at least one clause, even if fragmentary or lacking a finite verb
- Treat elliptical constructions (with implied subjects/verbs) as valid clauses
- For fragments, identify the implied elements and mark them in implied_elements

##Process

1. Identify all clauses within each AS-unit
2. Classify each clause as main, coordinate, subordinate, or non-finite
3. For subordinate clauses, specify the subtype (adverbial, relative, complement, subject)
4. Note any implied elements that are not explicitly stated

##Guidelines for Analysis

###Clause Types

1. **Main Clause**
   - Contains a subject and finite verb, can stand alone
   - Fragments and elliptical constructions count as main clauses with implied elements
   - Example: "I serves in a organization" → main clause
   - Example: "maybe twenty years" → main clause with implied elements ["it is", "it has been"]

2. **Coordinate Clause**
   - Joined to a main clause with coordinating conjunction (and, but, or)
   - Must have its own subject to be considered a separate clause
   - Could function independently if separated
   - Example: "I like pizza and she prefers pasta" → main + coordinate

3. **Subordinate Clause**
   - Depends on a main clause, introduced by a subordinating conjunction
   - Types:
     - **Adverbial**: "when I was in university, I specialized"
     - **Relative/Phrasal Post-modifier**: "I serve in an organization which is called department"
     - **Complement**: "I think that he knows nothing"
     - **Subject**: "That he knows nothing creates problems"

4. **Non-finite Clause **
   - Contains a non-finite verb form (infinitive, gerund, participle)
   - Must have at least one additional clause element beyond the verb
   - Example: "I want to study crop protection" → "to study crop protection" is non-finite



### Special Cases

1. **Fragments and Ellipsis**
   - Treat as main clauses with implied elements
   - Capture the explicit text and note the implied elements in the `implied_elements` field
   - Example: "maybe twenty years" → text: "maybe twenty years", implied_elements: ["it is", "it has been"]

2. **Questions**
   - Analyze as main clauses
   - Example: "what did you specialized" → main clause

3. **Compound Verbs**
   - Treat as part of a single clause
   - Example: "I wanted to study and I liked" → Two clauses (main + coordinate)

4. **Multiple AS-Units in Input**
   - Process each AS-unit independently, providing a separate clause analysis for each

##Input Format

The input will be a single AS-unit text:
```
{input_as_units}
```

##Output Format

Provide the output ONLY in the format specified below.
{format_instructions}
