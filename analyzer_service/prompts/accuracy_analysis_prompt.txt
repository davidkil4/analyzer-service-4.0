# Task: Analyze Grammatical Accuracy and Identify Errors

# Objective:
Compare the 'Original Clause' with the 'Corrected Clause'. Identify **all** grammatical, lexical, and stylistic errors present in the **Original Clause** that were addressed in the **Corrected Clause**. Do NOT identify errors that were *not* corrected.

# Input:
Original Clause: The student's original English text for a single clause.
Corrected Clause: The grammatically corrected and more natural version of the original clause.

# Error Identification Rules:
1.  **Focus on Correction:** Only list errors from the Original Clause that are fixed or improved in the Corrected Clause.
2.  **Be Specific:** Clearly describe the error and the specific correction made.
3.  **Categorize:** Assign each error to ONE relevant category from the provided list.
4.  **Assess Severity:** Assign a severity level ('critical', 'moderate', 'minor') based on the impact on communication, following the guidelines below.
5.  **No New Errors:** Do not introduce or comment on errors potentially present in the Corrected Clause itself.
6.  **Handle No Errors:** If the Original Clause was already correct and matches the Corrected Clause (or if the Corrected Clause is identical), output an empty list `[]`.

# Analysis Guidelines:

## STEP 1: DETERMINE SEVERITY
-------------------------
### CRITICAL Level:
- Renders sentence unintelligible WITHOUT context
- Meaning ambiguous even WITH context (e.g., wrong verb changes key action)
- Breaks basic grammatical structure
Examples:
- "Pizza very much like I" → "I like pizza very much"
- "Because went store" → "Because I went to the store"

### MODERATE Level:
- Meaning CLEAR WITH CONTEXT but requires effort to parse
- Structurally awkward but recoverable (e.g., missing article)
- Creates unnatural phrasing
Examples:
- "my very silent place I like" → "I like my very silent place"
- "spent my boring time" → "it helps me spend my boring time"

### MINOR Level:
- Does NOT hinder understanding; affects fluency/style
- Grammatically incorrect but socially acceptable in informal contexts
- Has obvious correction from context
Examples:
- "tennis elbow by bad golf" → "tennis elbow caused by bad golf"
- "big rain" → "heavy rain"

## STEP 2: ERROR CATEGORIES AND RULES
---------------------------------
-   **Word Order:**
    -   ONLY use if REORDERING EXISTING WORDS fixes error (no additions/deletions)
    -   Critical: When word sequence makes meaning unclear
    -   Moderate: When sequence is non-standard but meaning clear
    -   Examples:
        -   Critical: "Pizza very much like I" → "I like pizza very much"
        -   Moderate: "my very silent place I like" → "I like my very silent place"

-   **Sentence Structure:**
    -   Use when basic construction/expression wrong, including missing elements
    -   Critical: When structure makes meaning unclear
    -   Moderate: When structure awkward but meaning clear
    -   Examples:
        -   Critical: "My problem is only one" → "I have only one problem"
        -   Moderate: "First reason is I said near here" → "The first reason is that I mentioned I live near here"

-   **Conjunction Usage:**
    -   Use for errors with conjunctions (and/but/because/etc.)
    -   Critical: When connection between ideas unclear
    -   Moderate: When connection awkward but understandable
    -   Examples:
        -   Critical: "I like coffee by I'm tired" → "I like coffee but I'm tired"
        -   Moderate: "the reason is not tennis by playing golf" → "But the reason is not tennis, but playing golf"

-   **Compound Formation:**
    -   Use for errors in forming compound words/phrases
    -   Critical: When compound structure causes misunderstanding
    -   Moderate: When structure unnatural but meaning clear
    -   Examples:
        -   Critical: "air plane food sick" → "airplane food sickness"
        -   Moderate: "competition of companies" → "company competitions"

-   **Subject-Verb Agreement:**
    -   Use for errors/omissions affecting agreement, including missing copula
    -   Critical: When it causes ambiguity about who does what
    -   Moderate: When error clear from context
    -   Examples:
        -   Critical: "The children is happy and mother sad" → "The children are happy and mother is sad"
        -   Moderate: "He don't like coffee" → "He doesn't like coffee"

-   **Verb Tense/Aspect:**
    -   Use for incorrect/missing verb tense markers
    -   Critical: When time reference unclear
    -   Moderate: When context clarifies timing
    -   Examples:
        -   Critical: "Yesterday I eat pizza" → "Yesterday I ate pizza"
        -   Moderate: "I study English for 3 years" → "I have been studying English for 3 years"

-   **Auxiliary/Modal Verbs:**
    -   Use for errors with auxiliaries (do/does/did) or modals
    -   Moderate: When usage unnatural but understandable
    -   Minor: When form slightly off
    -   Examples:
        -   Moderate: "I will can speak English" → "I will be able to speak English"
        -   Minor: "Why you not come?" → "Why didn't you come?"

-   **Article/Preposition/Determiner/Quantifier:**
    -   Use for errors with articles (a, an, the), prepositions (in, on, at, etc.), determiners/quantifiers (this, that, some, any, etc.)
    -   Critical: When omission breaks sentence structure (e.g., missing mandatory preposition)
    -   Moderate: When meaning clear despite omission/error
    -   Examples:
        -   Critical: "He student" -> "He is a student" (Missing copula AND article, fits S-V agreement OR this rule)
        -   Moderate: "I go store" -> "I go to the store" (Missing preposition, missing article)
        -   Minor: "Give me apple" -> "Give me an apple" (Missing article)

-   **Noun Number:**
    -   Incorrect singular/plural form (e.g., "two apple" vs. "two apples").
    -   Severity based on clarity/standardness.
    -   Example:
        -   Moderate: "I have two dog" -> "I have two dogs"

-   **Pronoun Reference:**
    -   Incorrect pronoun (he, she, it, they) or unclear antecedent.
    -   Severity based on clarity.
    -   Example:
        -   Moderate: "The dog wagged his tail when it saw the ball" -> "The dog wagged its tail..."

-   **Word Choice (Lexical):**
    -   Use ONLY for incorrect word choices where meaning inferrable
    -   Moderate: When word choice unnatural but meaning clear
    -   Minor: When alternative word choice purely stylistic
    -   Examples:
        -   Moderate: "I said near here" → "I mentioned I live near here"
        -   Minor: "big rain" → "heavy rain"

-   **Spelling:**
    -   Misspelled words.
    -   Usually Minor unless it changes the word's meaning significantly (then Word Choice).

-   **Punctuation:**
    -   Incorrect or missing punctuation relevant to the clause meaning.
    -   Usually Minor.

-   **Formality/Register:**
    -   Use of language inappropriate for the conversational context (e.g., too formal/informal).
    -   Usually Minor.
