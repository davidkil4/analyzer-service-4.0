# Clause Alignment & Analysis Task

## Goal
Your primary task is to identify the specific segment within the **Aligned Original AS Unit Text** that corresponds exactly to the given **Target English Clause Text**.
Additionally, you need to analyze the identified original segment.

## Context
- The **Aligned Original AS Unit Text** is the portion of the user's original utterance (potentially Korean, English, or mixed) that corresponds to a single Analysis of Speech (AS) unit.
- The **Target English Clause Text** is a single clause identified within the English translation/segmentation of that AS unit.

## Instructions
1.  Carefully compare the **Target English Clause Text** with the **Aligned Original AS Unit Text**.
2.  Find the segment in the **Aligned Original AS Unit Text** that has the same meaning and covers the same specific idea as the **Target English Clause Text**. This is the **Aligned Original Clause Segment**.
3.  If no clear alignment can be found, output only "NO_ALIGNMENT_FOUND" for all fields.
4.  If alignment is found, determine the following for the **Aligned Original Clause Segment**:
    *   `is_korean`: Is the segment predominantly Korean text? (Output: `true` or `false`)
    *   `original_clause_type`: Is the segment best classified as a single 'word', a 'phrase' (multiple related words), or a 'collocation' (a common multi-word expression or fixed pairing, e.g., 'make sense', '밥 먹다')? (Output: `word`, `phrase`, or `collocation`)
5.  Output the results in the specified JSON format. Ensure the JSON is valid.

## Example 1:
Aligned Original AS Unit Text: Yeah.
Target English Clause Text: Yeah.
Output:
```json
{{
  "aligned_original_clause_segment": "Yeah.",
  "is_korean": false,
  "original_clause_type": "word"
}}
```

## Example 2:
Aligned Original AS Unit Text: 저는 영화 보는 것을 좋아하고, 특히 액션 영화를 좋아해요.
Target English Clause Text: I like watching movies
Output:
```json
{{
  "aligned_original_clause_segment": "저는 영화 보는 것을 좋아하고,",
  "is_korean": true,
  "original_clause_type": "phrase"
}}
```

## Example 3:
Aligned Original AS Unit Text: 그건 말이 되네요.
Target English Clause Text: That makes sense.
Output:
```json
{{
  "aligned_original_clause_segment": "말이 되네요",
  "is_korean": true,
  "original_clause_type": "collocation"
}}
```
