 a great question about data propagation through the pipeline.

Currently, additional fields like "teaching content" from the original input (scoring_output.json or equivalent) would not automatically appear in the final test_run_secondary_prioritized.json file. Here's why:

ZPD_analyzer.py (Primary Analysis): This script reads your input. When it generates the primary.json file, it essentially groups the complete original utterance dictionaries (including any extra fields like teaching content) under their assigned cluster. So, the teaching content would be present in primary.json.
ZPD_regions.py (Secondary Analysis): This script reads primary.json. However, when the write_secondary_json function processes the utterances for each ZPD region, it explicitly constructs a new utterance_data dictionary. It selectively copies specific fields (original, corrected, metrics, clauses, pattern_analysis) from the input utterance. Any fields not explicitly selected, like your "teaching content", are dropped at this stage. This is why the utterances list in secondary.json (and consequently secondary_prioritized.json) doesn't contain those extra fields.
ZPD_priority.py (Prioritization): This script reads secondary.json and again selects specific fields (original, corrected, metrics, errors, etc.) to include in its output along with the calculated priority score.
In summary: While the intermediate primary.json holds the full data, the subsequent scripts (ZPD_regions.py and ZPD_priority.py) filter the data, only carrying forward explicitly defined fields relevant to their analysis.

If you need the teaching content (or other fields) to be present in the final secondary_prioritized.json, we would need to modify primarily ZPD_regions.py (specifically write_secondary_json) to look for and copy those fields into the utterance_data structure it creates. We might also need a small adjustment in ZPD_priority.py depending on exactly how you want the final output structured.

Would you like me to modify the scripts to pass through specific extra fields? If so, please tell me the exact field names you want to include.
