# Security and Monitoring Plan for Analyzer Service

This plan outlines the steps to ensure the `analyzer_service` is secure and monitorable, especially considering its integration with a chat app and use of LLMs.

## Phase 1: Foundation (Implement Now/During Core Logic Development)

| Area         | Item                     | Implementation Detail                                                                    | Rationale                                                     |
|--------------|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------|
| Security     | **API Key Management**   | - Continue using `.env` for `GOOGLE_API_KEY`. <br> - Ensure `.env` is **always** in `.gitignore`.   | Prevent accidental key exposure in version control.             |
| Security     | **Input Validation**     | - Continue using Pydantic schemas (`AnalysisInputItem`) for data entering chains.        | Ensure data structure integrity, prevent basic malformed data. |
| Monitoring   | **Structured Logging**   | - Configure Python `logging` to output JSON format (using a library like `python-json-logger` is helpful). <br> - Log key events: start/end of processing, errors with stack traces, batch processing info. | Enables easier parsing and analysis by monitoring tools.      |
| Monitoring   | **LangSmith Integration**| - Set up LangSmith environment variables (`LANGCHAIN_TRACING_V2=true`, `LANGCHAIN_API_KEY`, `LANGCHAIN_PROJECT`). <br> - Ensure chains run with tracing enabled (default if env vars are set). | Deep visibility into LangChain runs for debugging & performance analysis. |
| Security     | **Dependency Management**| - Maintain a `requirements.txt` or `pyproject.toml`. <br> - Periodically check for updates and vulnerabilities (e.g., using `pip-audit`). | Mitigate risks from vulnerable outdated packages.             |
| Security     | **Prompt Injection Awareness**| - Carefully review how user text from the chat app is incorporated into LLM prompts. <br> - **Avoid** directly inserting raw user input as instructions to the LLM. Use templating carefully. | Prevent malicious users from hijacking LLM behavior.      |

## Phase 2: API Endpoint Implementation (When exposing the service via API)

| Area         | Item                     | Implementation Detail                                                                    | Rationale                                                               |
|--------------|--------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Security     | **API Framework**        | - Implement using a web framework. **FastAPI** is highly recommended due to its excellent Pydantic integration and async support. | Provides structure for handling web requests, routing, input/output validation. |
| Security     | **Authentication**       | - Implement simple API Key authentication for the endpoint. <br> - The chat app must send this key in a request header (e.g., `X-API-Key`). The service validates it. | Ensures only the authorized chat app can access the service.             |
| Security     | **Rate Limiting**        | - Implement rate limiting using framework middleware (e.g., `slowapi` for FastAPI) based on the incoming API key or IP address. | Protects against Denial-of-Service (DoS) attacks and controls LLM costs. |
| Monitoring   | **Health Check Endpoint**| - Create a simple `/health` endpoint that performs a basic check (e.g., returns HTTP 200 OK) without hitting the LLM. | Allows external systems (chat app, load balancers, monitoring tools) to quickly check service availability. |
| Monitoring   | **Enhanced Logging**     | - Add a unique request ID to every log message generated during a single API request. <br> - Log the total request processing time and specific timings for crucial steps (like LLM calls). | Enables tracing a single request's flow and pinpointing performance bottlenecks. |

## Phase 3: Deployment & Ongoing Maintenance

| Area         | Item                     | Implementation Detail                                                                     | Rationale                                                              |
|--------------|--------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Monitoring   | **Metrics Collection**   | - Instrument the API (e.g., using `prometheus-fastapi-instrumentator`) to expose metrics (request count, error count, latency percentiles). <br> - Monitor LLM token usage via LangSmith or logs. | Quantitative overview of service health, performance, and resource/cost consumption. |
| Monitoring   | **Alerting**             | - Set up alerts (e.g., using Prometheus Alertmanager, CloudWatch Alarms) based on metric thresholds (e.g., spike in error rate, high p99 latency, excessive token usage). | Proactive notification of potential problems requiring attention.        |
| Security     | **Secret Management (Optional)** | - For production, consider migrating secrets (`GOOGLE_API_KEY`, service API key) to a dedicated service (AWS Secrets Manager, GCP Secret Manager, HashiCorp Vault). | Centralized, audited, and more secure secret storage than `.env` files. |
| Security     | **Regular Audits**       | - Periodically review configurations, dependencies (run `pip-audit`), logs, and access controls for potential security weaknesses or anomalies.          | Maintain security posture over time as the system evolves.              |



Looking back at our security and monitoring.md plan, Phase 1 included:

API Key Management (Done)
Input Validation (Using Pydantic - we'll continue this)
Structured Logging (We have basic logging, but not structured JSON yet)
LangSmith Integration (Done)
Dependency Management (Implicitly done, will formalize later)
Prompt Injection Awareness (Ongoing concern)
The most critical item to set up before modifying the analysis chain was LangSmith Integration, which we've just completed.

While Structured Logging (outputting logs in JSON format) is valuable, we can defer implementing that library (python-json-logger) until we build the actual API endpoint in Phase 2, as that's when aggregating and searching logs becomes most important. Our current logging is sufficient for development debugging alongside LangSmith.
